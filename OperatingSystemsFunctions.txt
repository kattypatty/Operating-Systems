Home is the standard version of Windows 10 which is designed primarily for the general user
who performs standard tasks commitments at home. Windows 10 supports applications that can 
be used across all compatible Microsoft devices and get regularly updated. Unfortunately, 
Windows 10 doesn't come installed with the full Office suite usually (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.), 
but it didn't prevent it from becoming the most used OS among people. 



Android is a Linux based operating system created primarily for touch screens mobile devices 
such as smartphones and tablet computers. Android aims to offer affordable high-tech devices,
and it's a powerful operating system that supports a large number of advanced applications 
that help people manage their lives. 



Following the rise of smartphones' popularity, Microsoft invented in 2010 a Windows phone which 
is a completely new mobile operating system version in reply to Apple and Android that stunned
their consumers who didn't previously have anything similar. C# is the language of Windows Mobile
which is very similar to C++ and Java, but for some functions, Windows has adopted them from Java. 
Like other phones, Windows Phone supports application functions and has its own application
repository. The graphic design of the user interface is very recognizable which consists of
interesting features such as "alive" titles instead of notifications and built-in integration
that allows its users to set up their email boxes.
