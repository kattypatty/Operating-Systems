Home is the standard version of Windows 10 which is designed primarily for the general user
who performs standard tasks commitments at home. Windows 10 supports applications that can 
be used across all compatible Microsoft devices and get regularly updated. Unfortunately, 
Windows 10 doesn't come installed with the full Office suite usually (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.), 
but it didn't prevent it from becoming the most used OS among people.
